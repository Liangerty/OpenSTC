// Specify the method to compute transport properties. Mainly specify the diffusivity computation method.
// Viscosity and thermal_conductivity are computed by collision integral methods if multi-species simulation is assumed.
// Diffusivity is a per-species property and only need to be computed when species are turned on.

// There are 3 methods to compute diffusivity in this code.
// 0 - collision integral method: using the formula given by White's book
// 1 - constant Schmidt number method: by giving a Schmidt number, all species diffusivity are assumed to be \mu/Sc
// 2 - constant Lewis number per species: specify the Lewis number for every species and the D is computed by D_i=\alpha/Le_i
